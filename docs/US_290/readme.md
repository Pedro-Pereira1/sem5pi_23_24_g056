# US 290 - As a Campus Manager, I want to list elevators in building

## 1. Context

* This task comes in context of Sprint A.
* First time that this task is developed.
* This task is relative to system user Campus Manager.

## 2. Requirements

**US 290 -** As a Campus Manager, I want to:

* list elevators in a building.

**Client Clarifications**
>**Question**: "...Que informacoes pretende, então, ver sobre esse elevador?"<br>
><br> **Answer** : "...pretende-se listar todas as informações do elevador."


**Dependencies:**
* This User Stories requires that there are buildings, floors and elevators created, so it has dependencies on US150, US190 and US270.

## 3. Analysis

Regarding this requirement we understand that: As a Campus Manager, an actor of the system, I will be able to list the
information of elevators of a building, such as brand, description, model, identification number, serial number and floors that it goes.
* Campus Manager is a user role that manages the data of the routes and maps.
* Building is a structure within the campus that houses various rooms and facilities. It can be navigated by the robisep robots using corridors and elevators.
* Floor is a level within a building. Each floor can contain multiple rooms and is accessible by elevators and stairs (though robisep robots cannot use stairs).
* Elevator is a transport device for moving between different floors of a building.

### 4.2. Applied Patterns
* Controller
* Service
* Repository
* Mapper
* DTO
* GRASP

### 4.3. Tests

**Test 1:** *Verifies that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.*

```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
	Example instance = new Example(null, null);
}

## 5. Implementation

*In this section the team should present, if necessary, some evidencies that the implementation is according to the design. It should also describe and explain other important artifacts necessary to fully understand the implementation like, for instance, configuration files.*

*It is also a best practice to include a listing (with a brief summary) of the major commits regarding this requirement.*

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

*In this section the team should describe the efforts realized in order to integrate this functionality with the other parts/components of the system*

*It is also important to explain any scripts or instructions required to execute an demonstrate this functionality*

## 7. Observations

*This section should be used to include any content that does not fit any of the previous sections.*

*The team should present here, for instance, a critical prespective on the developed work including the analysis of alternative solutioons or related works*

*The team should include in this section statements/references regarding third party works that were used in the development this work.*
